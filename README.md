Best Practices for Building REST Apis
---

Ive been building API for Service Oriented Applications for over a decade. Many API design opinions and guidelines I have found are more academic in nature and less real world. My goal with this article is to describe the best practices for a pragmatic API approach based on my experience. Ive found the following items to be the key to the success of all of my systems.

1. Adoption
2. Standards and Consistency
3. Self Discovery
4. Intuitive

## Adoption

The number one challenge I have consistently had is, resistance. While you might think it makes sense to add a layer of abstraction, apply single responsibility prinicpal to each layer, or create a stable elastic system to your total solution landscape, you will find that not everyone will agree. This is usually founded in either the fact that it will inherently make the over all design more complex, or the users of your system enjoy the nature of traditional single layer systems. In either case, you will be forced to nuture the idea and advocate the adoption.

### Documentation

Use tools like [Swagger.io](http://Swagger.io) to build a design first approach. The added benefit is the restlting markdown can be used to create Client and Server stubs. The downside is this tool is discounted from the code ( unlike Java Annotation ).
