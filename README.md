Best Practices for Building REST Apis
---

Ive been building API for Service Oriented Applications for over a decade. Ive found the following to be the key to the success of all of my systems.

1. Adoption
2. Standards and Consistency
3. Self Discovery
4. Intuitive

## Adoption

The number one challenge I have consistently had is resistance. While you might think it makes sense to add a layer of abstraction and also create a stable system to your solution landscape, you will find that not everyone agrees. This is usually founded in either the fact that it will inherently make the over all design more complex, or the users of your system enjoy the nature of traditional single layer systems.

## Standards and Consistency

## Self Discovery

## Intuitive
